    <h2>What is Microservices Architecture:</h2>

  <p><cite>Microservice Architecture</cite>is about decomposing a Software System
     into autonomus Units which are independently deployable and which communicates
      via lightweight, language agnostic way and together they fulfill the business goal.</p>

      <h2>Why Need Microservices:</h2>

      <p>In 1960s  there was a rapid growth of computing applications and  software became
           large and complex. Computer Scientists tried to tackle the complexity of Software
            Systems with the ancient and proven technique: Divide and Conquer. But growth in 
        software increase day by day computer Scientists need a new solution for their software 
    development this problem lead to a new concept 
    <q><cite>Modular Software Development</cite> </q> in the 1970s with the principal of decomposing
     a large, complex software system into “Loosely coupled, highly cohesive” modules which communicated
      via internal interfaces. In simple terms, “loosely coupled” means the dependency between modules
       should be very low and “highly cohesive” means that one module should focus on single or similar
        functionality. With the rise of the Internet and Web in the 1990s, software systems became widespread
         in business applications and became even more complex and large. Although Modularity is used to
          reduce the complexities of software application, it often did not help as the soft Modular boundaries
           of software sub-systems are easy to cross and misuse. Another Software Architecture pattern became
            very popular during the 1990s to develop business applications: <cite>Layered Architecture</cite>.
             Normally, a business Web Application is divided into several layers.</p>
