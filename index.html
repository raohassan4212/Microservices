    <h2>What is Microservices Architecture:</h2>

  <p><cite>Microservice Architecture</cite>is about decomposing a Software System
     into autonomus Units which are independently deployable and which communicates
      via lightweight, language agnostic way and together they fulfill the business goal.</p>

      <h2>Why Need Microservices:</h2>

      <p>In 1960s  there was a rapid growth of computing applications and  software became
           large and complex. Computer Scientists tried to tackle the complexity of Software
            Systems with the ancient and proven technique: Divide and Conquer. But growth in 
        software increase day by day computer Scientists need a new solution for their software 
    development this problem lead to a new concept 
    <q><cite>Modular Software Development</cite> </q> in the 1970s with the principal of decomposing
     a large, complex software system into “Loosely coupled, highly cohesive” modules which communicated
      via internal interfaces. In simple terms, “loosely coupled” means the dependency between modules
       should be very low and “highly cohesive” means that one module should focus on single or similar
        functionality. With the rise of the Internet and Web in the 1990s, software systems became widespread
         in business applications and became even more complex and large. Although Modularity is used to
          reduce the complexities of software application, it often did not help as the soft Modular boundaries
           of software sub-systems are easy to cross and misuse. Another Software Architecture pattern became
            very popular during the 1990s to develop business applications: <cite>Layered Architecture</cite>.
             Normally, a business Web Application is divided into several layers.</p>

    <!-- paragrah of monolithic architecture -->
    <center> <p>There is an other popular architecture to handle the complexities of software development called 
        <cite>Monolithic architecture</cite>. But in the late 2000s, a Cambrian Explosion
         happens in the software industries due to the rise of Mobile Internet (Wifi, Smartphone) and faster
          network. Also, software started to eat the world where along with the traditional Software/Technology
           companies, almost all types of companies started to develop or use software like Banking, Insurance,
            Restaurants, Hotels, Music, Driving, etc. Many new companies like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Netflix,
             Spotify came with innovative ideas, aggressive strategy, move fast approach which leads to the
              exponential growth of their applications. Suddenly, Organizations and Software Engineers found
               that Monolithic Architecture cannot handle the challenges of Modern, Fast-Paced or Web-Scale
                Software development. and there comes the microservices the modern game changer software industry. </p></center>

                <h2>Microservices Architecture in Detail:</h2>
                <p>The idea is to split your application into a set of smaller, interconnected services instead
                     of building a single monolithic application. Each microservice is a small application that
                      has its own hexagonal architecture consisting of business logic along with various adapters.
                    The differet between <cite>Monolithic Architecture</cite> and <cite>Microservice Architecture</cite>
                are below figure.</p>

              <p>The Microservice architecture pattern significantly impacts the relationship between the application
                   and the database. Instead of sharing a single database schema with other services, each service has
                    its own database schema. On the one hand, this approach is at odds with the idea of an
                     enterprise-wide data model. Also, it often results in duplication of some data. However,
                      having a database schema per service is essential if you want to benefit from microservices,
                       because it ensures loose coupling. Each of the services has its own database. Moreover, a
                        service can use a type of database that is best suited to its needs, the so-called polyglot
                         persistence architecture.</p>
